Start in the agentic workflow 
Inside, we have the GraphBuilder class that has 3 functioons. It has the agent function and the build graph function 
The buildgraph initiates the graph and adds the node functions. The 2nd node is the tools node. 
Edges is the connectivity 
The llm model comes from the model loader that we created. 
The model loader code has the models that we will be using
After loading the LLM we will pass it to the agent function and binding the tools. 
We will then invoke the llm and then the prompt is being pulled as the input to the model. 
The Graph Builder  - we created an endpoint in the APP.PY file. 
We will call the Graph BUilder object. The graph will be created and saved. 

Langchain allows us to create various tools that the Agent relies on to do its specific tasks
from langchain.tools import tool - @tool then def the tool

What does @staticmethod do?
What does "dict" do?
